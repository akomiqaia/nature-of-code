# Nature of Code
The coding train explores topics ranging from basic mathematics and physics concepts to more advanced simulations of complex systems. Subjects covered include physics simulation, trigonometry, self-organization, genetic algorithms, and neural networks. Examples are demonstrated in JavaScript using p5.js.

## [noise()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noise)

It was invented By Ken Perlin in the 1980s is mostly sued in hraphical applications to produce textures, natural motion, shapes, terrains etc.

Perlin Noise returns Perlin noise value at specific coordinates.

Perlin Noise is a random sequence generator producing a more natural ordered, harmonic succession of numbers compared to random() funciton.
